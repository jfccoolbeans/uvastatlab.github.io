      <description>First off, what is endogeneity, and why would we want to simulate it?
Endogeneity occurs when a statistical model has an independent variable that is correlated with the error term. The reason we would want to simulate it is to understand what exactly that definition means!
Letâ€™s first simulate ideal data for simple linear regression using R.
# independent variablex &amp;lt;- seq(1,5,length.out = 100) # error (uncorrelated with x)set.</description>
