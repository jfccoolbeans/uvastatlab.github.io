      <description>In a previous post we demonstrated how to perform a basic mediation analysis. In this post we look at performing a moderated mediation analysis.
The basic idea is that a mediator may depend on another variable called a “moderator”. For example, in our mediation analysis post we hypothesized that self-esteem was a mediator of student grades on the effect of student happiness. We illustrate this below with a path diagram.</description>

      <description>What is mediation?Let’s say previous studies have suggested that higher grades predict higher happiness: X (grades) \(\rightarrow\) Y (happiness). (This research example is made up for illustration purposes. Please don’t consider it a scientific statement.)
I think, however, grades are not the real reason that happiness increases. I hypothesize that good grades boost one’s self-esteem and then high self-esteem boosts one’s happiness: X (grades) \(\rightarrow\) M (self-esteem) \(\rightarrow\) Y (happiness).</description>
