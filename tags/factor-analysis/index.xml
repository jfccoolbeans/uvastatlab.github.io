      <description>Take a look at the following correlation matrix for Olympic decathlon data calculated from 280 scores from 1960 through 2004 (Johnson and Wichern, p.Â 499):
If we focus on the first row, 100m (100 meter dash), we see that it has fairly high correlations with LJ and 400m (long jump and 400 meter dash, 0.64 and 0.55) and somewhat lower correlations with all other events. Scoring high in the 100 meter dash seems to correlate with scoring high in the long jump and 400 meter run but gives no solid indication of performance in the other events.</description>
